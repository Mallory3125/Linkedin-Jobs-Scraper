## ‚úÖ Week 2: Skill & Info Extraction

### Must Do
- [ ] Extract technical skills from requirements section (using regex or NLP)
- [ ] Normalize similar terms (e.g., ‚ÄúPython 3‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúPython‚Äù)
- [ ] Create structured job records with:
  - [ ] Title
  - [ ] Required skills

- [ ] Try tagging job level (Junior/Mid/Senior) based on text heuristics

### Avoid (Time Sink)
- ‚ùå Building a perfect skill extractor ‚Äî aim for 80% accuracy
- ‚ùå Manually curating a huge tech skill dictionary

## ‚úÖ Week 3: Analysis & Visualization

### Must Do
- [ ] Identify top skills per role (e.g., Data Analyst vs. ML Engineer)
- [ ] Compare role expectations (tools, verbs used, qualifications)
- [ ] Visualize findings (bar charts, word clouds, etc.)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Cluster job descriptions using sentence embeddings (e.g., BERT)
- [ ] Visualize clusters with UMAP/t-SNE

  - [ ] Project goal & motivation
  - [ ] Pipeline overview
  - [ ] Key findings and visualizations
- [ ] Push final code & results to GitHub

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Create a simple Streamlit dashboard demo
- [ ] Add job export (e.g., top matching jobs to CSV)

- ‚ùå Spending too long tweaking frontend styling
- ‚ùå Writing a full blog post unless you finish early
